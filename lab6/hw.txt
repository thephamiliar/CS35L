1. If the other teams had been observing all the bytes going across the network,
the resulting network would still be secure since openssh establishes a secure
network using encryption and decryption between server and client. With openssh,
all the data being passed between the client and server would be encrypted and
would be unknown to the other.  (1) The network would no longer be secure if the
other team had also tapped my keyboards and had observed all of my team's
keystrokes, since they could trace the password back and create their own
connection with the server. (2) The network would not be secure if the other
team had physical control of the USB I am booting off of since they would have
direct access to the server and can bypass the password lock, avoiding having to
decrypt a file even if it is encrypted.

2. The verify command merely checks whether the name, key, and comment match the
one that created the file. It does not check whether the person trying to access
the file is the creator of the file.  In order to verify that I personally
created the tar file in question, I would asymmetically encrypt the file. As a
result, since the true owner would be the only one who can decrypt the file with
the private key, I would be able to validate that the file was created by
myself.
