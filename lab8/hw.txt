###### MOST DANGEROUS ######
1. VU #945216 The most dangerous vulnerability would be the remote integer overflow because the
attacker can execute code with the privileges of the SSH daemon. The attacker would have the
privileges of the root user and the only current way to prevent this is to apply the available
patches or to disable support for SSH1 until a more permanent solution is found.
2. VU #774103 The next most urgent vulnerability would be the array out-of-bound access privilege
escalation vulnerability because it allows the attacker to bypass privileges and gain access to
resources that are normally protected to unauthenticated users. In this way, the attacker can
make unauthorized actions. This can be resolved with an update by the corresponding affected
distribution.
3. VU #237655 This vulnerability consists of a use-after-free vulnerability in the CGenericElement
object. The impact of this vulnerability is that an attacker can execute code as if they are the
user. In this way, the attacker can create a website that exploits this vulnerability and have the
user view their website. This is less dangerous than the previous ones because this only applies to
the Internet Explorer application, whereas the other two can exploit the server as a whole.
4. VU #127108 The buffer overflow vulnerability can crash the application. There are no practical
solutions to this problem, but this does not have as wide as an impact as the previous
vulnerabilities since it doesn't exploit the server.
5. VU #912420 The least dangerous vulnerability is the IBM Notes one because it can be resolved with
an upgrade and only triggers an HTTP request, rather than making the user to a website like the
vulnerability #237655.
