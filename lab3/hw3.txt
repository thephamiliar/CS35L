1. Yes, it was necessary because now the ls command will not default to the ISO
format when a format is not specified. By deleting this case, the ls command
will print out the traditional Unix format by default.

2. If the patched version were to be used, some bugs that one should take into
account is that the ISO format has been the default format. So, by changing the
default format, it may caugse bugs in scripts parsing ls output. Also, the date
format seems to be associated with the country rather than the language, so in
non-English speaking countries, the format translation may not be available.  

3. In Python, the Index Error message comes up because in the random script, the
IndexError is raised if the sequence is empty there is nothing in the sequence
to return. 

4. For Python3, the syntax error comes up because the except syntax does not
allow the syntax "except IOError as (errno, strerror):". After changing the
clause after "as," two errors came up when you build the program with an empty
file: ValueError and IndexError. Both these errors occur in the random script
because the functions cannot handle cases where the number of bits is zero or
when the sequence is empty.
