To retrieve Coureutils, we use the wget command to download the file and tar to
unzip the files

wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
tar -xzcf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

Make a temporary directory to install Coreutils, so that it does not override
the default settings of Linux

mkdir ~/coreutilsInstall
cd coreutils-7.6

Read the INSTALL file of Coreutils to find the necessary prefix tag to install
Coreutils directly into the temporary directory; steps to install Coreutils:
1. configure 2. make 3. make install

vim INSTALL
./configure --prefix=/coreutilsInstall
make
make install prefix=~/coreutilsInstall
cd..

Check that the files were installed into the temporary directory and reproduce
the bug

cd coreutilsInstall
cd bin
./ls -l
cd ..
cd coreutils-7.6
cd src
./ls -l
cd ..
cd ..

Copy the patch and apply it to the Coreutils directory

vim patch_file
cd coreutils-7.6
vim patch_file

Make sure the patch_file is executable

chmod +x patch_file
patch -p1 < patch_file

Remake/update the newly patched files
make
cd src

Check to see if the bug has been resolved
./ls -l
